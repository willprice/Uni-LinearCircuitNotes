# Week 1
## Intro to electricity

* Current
* Voltage
* Charge
* Resistor

### Current
- Current is the movement of charges in a conductor.
- Charges in a current are in motion because they are pushed along by and
  electrical force.
- Charge is measured in Coulombs *C*
- Current is measured in *Cs^-1*, or the *Amp (A)*
- 1 Coulomb contains 6.10^18 electrons
- Current is directional

### Voltage
Voltage between *two points* is a difference in energy level of a unit charge
located at each of the two points

- Energy has the units *Joules (J)*
- Units: *Joules per second (Js^-1)* or *Volts*
- Voltage is directional

UK electricity has varying voltage and current (50Hz). Current (or voltage) is a
function of time.


* Quantities that are constant are called *direct*
* Quantities that vary sinusoidally are called *alternating*


### Linear circuits
* Linear circuits consisnnt of an interconnection of linear circuit elements
* A linear circuit 

Linearity defined mathematically:
* Additivity `f(x + y) = f(x) + f(y)`
* Scaling `f(a*x) = a*f(x)`
